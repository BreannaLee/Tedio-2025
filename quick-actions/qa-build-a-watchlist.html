            <h2>How to do it</h2>
            <div class="bullets">
                <ol>
                    <li>Check out the right expert-curated playlists and contents on the left</li>
                    <li>Add them to your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbiu1_nYFSQ&t=30s">YouTube playlist</a> or save the playlist to watch for later</li>
                    <li>Tip: Press ‚Äúlike‚Äù or subscribe to the channel that parents actually liked so that the algorithm can recommend similar content.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
              <h2>Why it helps</h2>
              <p>It's better to pause a good full-length video than to watch many 
              low-quality shorts. Think about films you've enjoyed and would want 
              to share with your child, or YouTube channels recommended by teachers. </p>
              <p>This doesn't need to be complicated‚Äîsimply note down 
                these suggestions when you come across them and add them 
                to a YouTube playlist. Here are some suggestions by Common 
                Sense in case you are actively searching for resources.</p>
              <p>Parents and Kids can do this together; they talk about 
                what videos are good, why are they good, how does such 
                video make kids feel, why should kids not such video, etc.</p>
              <h2>Tips üí¨</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Kids learn more when you watch together. If you can‚Äôt, asking about the show later is still a great way to connect.
                <li>Use Common Sense Media to check if a show, game, or video is age-appropriate.</li>
                <li>Avoid leaving the TV on in the background‚Äîit can affect focus and mood.</li>
                <li>Be mindful of harmful themes. Sage Parent‚Äôs Content Rubric can help you spot what to avoid.</li>
              </ol>
              <h2>Content Rubric</h2>
              <p>In collaboration with child-development experts, Sage Parents developed a rubric to detail specific types of content we recommend limiting or avoiding altogether for kids in elementary school.</p>

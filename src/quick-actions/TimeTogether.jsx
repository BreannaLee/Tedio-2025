                <ol>
                  <li>Observe when your child is about to dive into screen time out of boredom or habit.</li>
                  <li>Offer a warm alternative with a smile: "Hey, let's take a silly walk to the park 
                    together," or "Want to snuggle up and watch a movie with me instead?"
                  <br />*Tip: Get kids outside as much as you can. Research shows that kids 
                  who have more physical activity and outdoor play have better relationships with peers.</li>
                  <li>Keep it specific and short-term â€” the activity should sound easy and fun.</li>
                  <li>Match their energy level: Choose something calm if they seem tired 
                    or something active if they're fidgety.</li>
                  <li>Celebrate the switch with affirming language: "That was fun! I'm glad we did that together."</li>

              <h2>Why it helps</h2>
              <p>Research shows that when kids lead their own playâ€”especially creative 
                or adventurous playâ€”they build better focus, emotional control, and 
                mental health over time. But playtime is shrinking. While 70% of 
                today's parents played outside daily as kids, only 31% say their 
                own kids do the same. As children grow, play often gets pushed 
                aside for screens or packed schedules. Tweens now average 5.5 
                hours of non-school screen time daily.<br />
              <br />Kids up to age 12 (and beyond) still need lots of free, 
              tech-free playtimeâ€”not just sports or structured activities. 
              This kind of play can include art, puzzles, cooking, made-up 
              games, or kicking a ball around. Whether it's alone, with siblings, 
              or friends, unstructured play is key to healthy developmentâ€”and it's worth protecting.<br />

              <h2>Tips ðŸ’¬</h2>
              <p>Kids are more likely to say "yes" to together-time if it feels genuinely fun, not like a <b>forced replacement</b>.<br />
              <br />Use small rituals â€” Friday movie night, walk after dinner, weekend waffles â€” to <b>build routines that feel special</b>. <br />
              <br />Even 15 minutes of shared time can meet a child's need for connection and 
              reduce their urge to fill space with solo screen use.<br />
              <br />Frame it as "doing something cool with you" â€” not "taking the screen away."</p>

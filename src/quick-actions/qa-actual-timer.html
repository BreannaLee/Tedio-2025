            <div class="bullets">
                <ol>
                    <li>Place a kitchen timer—or any physical timer—in a 
                      shared space like the living room, where everyone 
                      (parents and children) can see it. Set a clear, 
                      visible screen time limit as a public family commitment.</li>
                    <li>As a general guide, the UK’s recommended screen time limits are: </li>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Ages 0–2: No screen time (except for video calls)</li>
                      <li>Ages 2–5: Up to 1 hour per day</li>
                      <li>Ages 6–12: Up to 2 hours per day</li>
                      <li>Ages 13+: Ideally no more than 2 hours per day<br>
                        *These UK guidelines are based on recent child-digital 
                        well being research and are widely used in studies 
                        on healthy media habits. (Source: How Much Screen

            <h2>Why it helps</h2>
            <p>Provides a tangible endpoint instead of relying on in-app service that kids can ignore.</p>
            <h2>Tips 💬</h2>
            <p>Frame this exercise as a cool brain challenge.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, children struggle with discipline simply because 
              the rules around when to stop aren’t clear or consistent.</p>

            <p>By setting clear, physical boundaries (like a timer or a 
              visual schedule) parents and children can better communicate 
              when it’s time to watch YouTube and when it’s time to stop. 
              This not only reduces confusion but also helps children learn 
              important values like keeping promises, taking responsibility, 
              and practicing self-discipline.</p>

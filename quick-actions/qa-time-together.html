            <div class="bullets">
                <ol>
                    <li>Observe when your child is about to dive into screen time out of boredom or habit.</li>
                    <li>Offer a warm alternative with a smile: “Hey, let’s take a silly walk to the park 
                      together,” or “Want to snuggle up and watch a movie with me instead?”
                    <br>*Tip: Get kids outside as much as you can. Research shows that kids 
                    who have more physical activity and outdoor play have better relationships with peers.</li>
                    <li>Keep it specific and short-term — the activity should sound easy and fun.</li>
                    <li>Match their energy level: Choose something calm if they seem tired 
                      or something active if they’re fidgety.</li>
                    <li>Celebrate the switch with affirming language: “That was fun! I’m glad we did that together.”</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Why it helps</h2>
            <p>Research shows that when kids lead their own play—especially creative 
              or adventurous play—they build better focus, emotional control, and 
              mental health over time. But playtime is shrinking. While 70% of 
              today’s parents played outside daily as kids, only 31% say their 
              own kids do the same. As children grow, play often gets pushed 
              aside for screens or packed schedules. Tweens now average 5.5 
              hours of non-school screen time daily.<br>
            <br>Kids up to age 12 (and beyond) still need lots of free, 
            tech-free playtime—not just sports or structured activities. 
            This kind of play can include art, puzzles, cooking, made-up 
            games, or kicking a ball around. Whether it’s alone, with siblings, 
            or friends, unstructured play is key to healthy development—and it’s worth protecting.<br>

            <h2>Tips 💬</h2>
            <p>Kids are more likely to say “yes” to together-time if it feels genuinely fun, not like a <b>forced replacement</b>>.<br>
            <br>Use small rituals — Friday movie night, walk after dinner, weekend waffles — to <b>build routines that feel special</b>. <br>
            <br>Even 15 minutes of shared time can meet a child's need for connection and 
            reduce their urge to fill space with solo screen use.<br>
            <br>Frame it as “doing something cool with you” — not “taking the screen away.”</p>

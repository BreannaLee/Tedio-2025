                <ol>
                    <li>Place a kitchen timerâ€”or any physical timerâ€”in a 
                      shared space like the living room, where everyone 
                      (parents and children) can see it. Set a clear, 
                      visible screen time limit as a public family commitment.</li>
                    <li>As a general guide, the UKâ€™s recommended screen time limits are: </li>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Ages 0â€“2: No screen time (except for video calls)</li>
                      <li>Ages 2â€“5: Up to 1 hour per day</li>
                      <li>Ages 6â€“12: Up to 2 hours per day</li>
                      <li>Ages 13+: Ideally no more than 2 hours per day<br>
                        *These UK guidelines are based on recent child-digital 
                        well being research and are widely used in studies 
                        on healthy media habits. (Source: How Much Screen

            <p>Frame this exercise as a cool brain challenge.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, children struggle with discipline simply because 
              the rules around when to stop arenâ€™t clear or consistent.</p>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <!-- ITME TIMMER PICTURE -->
            <p>By setting clear, physical boundaries (like a timer or a 
              visual schedule) parents and children can better communicate 
              when itâ€™s time to watch YouTube and when itâ€™s time to stop. 
              This not only reduces confusion but also helps children learn 
              important values like keeping promises, taking responsibility, 
              and practicing self-discipline.</p>

            <p>Making Shorts less accessible in the first place to 
              prevent mindlessly entering the endless loop. This 
              encourages <b>intentional viewing</b>.</p>

              <b>‚ÄúThere are so many fun things in the world!</b><br>
              Think about the last time you found something 
              interesting‚Äîmaybe on the street, at school, or 
              anywhere else. It could have been watching 
              ants march in a straight line, or looking up 
              at the sky to see airplanes and imagining where they might be going.<br>
              <br>When you stay curious and look at the world with 
              playful eyes, there are endless little joys to notice. 
              (Here you can compliment your child‚Äôs inherent curiosity 
              here with real examples in the past).<br>
              <br>But flashy, exciting videos are made to pull 
              our attention away. Even though they can be fun, 
              they weaken your ability to appreciate cute, fun, 
              and interesting pieces, especially in the real world! 
              YouTube can be great, but do you want it to take 
              away your curious, playful mind?<br>
              <br><b>Let‚Äôs remember how special our curiosity is, 
              and how many little treasures are waiting for 
              us when we look around. When we keep that curiosity, 
              the number of joyful moments we find can grow a hundred times over.‚Äù</b></p>
